17. ✓ Large numbers - Working (999999999 × 999999999)
18. ✓ Zero values - Working (0 × 100 = 0)

**Database Verification:**
- ✓ Database connection successful
- ✓ Calculations stored correctly (14 records verified)
- ✓ History retrieval working
- ✓ All operation types properly stored

**External Access:**
- ✓ Backend exposed at: https://calculator-backend-morphvm-upq2ibiu.http.cloud.morph.so
- ✓ All endpoints accessible externally
- ✓ CORS properly configured

**Server Status:**
- ✓ Node.js process running (PID: 17790)
- ✓ Server listening on port 3001
- ✓ Database connection stable

### Issues Found:

#### ISSUE #1: Floating Point Precision
- **Severity**: Minor
- **Description**: Decimal multiplication shows JavaScript floating-point precision issues (3.14 × 2.5 = 7.8500000000000005 instead of 7.85)
- **Impact**: Frontend display might show extra decimal places
- **Status**: DOCUMENTED - Will address in frontend with rounding
- **Solution**: Frontend should round results to reasonable decimal places (e.g., 10 digits)

#### ISSUE #2: No Request Logging
- **Severity**: Minor
- **Description**: Backend doesn't log incoming requests for debugging/monitoring
- **Impact**: Harder to debug issues in production
- **Status**: DOCUMENTED - Low priority for MVP
- **Solution**: Could add morgan or similar logging middleware

#### ISSUE #3: No Rate Limiting
- **Severity**: Minor
- **Description**: No rate limiting on API endpoints
- **Impact**: API could be abused with excessive requests
- **Status**: DOCUMENTED - Not critical for MVP
- **Solution**: Could add express-rate-limit middleware

### Summary:
**All critical functionality working as expected. Backend is production-ready for Step 2.**

### Non-Issues (Working as Expected):
- Error handling for division by zero ✓
- Error handling for square root of negative numbers ✓
- Error handling for invalid operations ✓
- Error handling for missing operands ✓
- Error handling for invalid operand types ✓
- CORS configuration ✓
- Database persistence ✓
- External URL accessibility ✓

## Step 2 - Frontend Development & Integration

### Frontend Implementation Completed ✓

**Created Components:**
1. ✓ React App with Vite build tool
2. ✓ Calculator UI component (App.jsx)
3. ✓ Modern dark theme CSS (App.css)
4. ✓ Responsive design (mobile, tablet, desktop)
5. ✓ Calculator display with operation indicator
6. ✓ Number pad (0-9, decimal point)
7. ✓ Basic operations (+, −, ×, ÷)
8. ✓ Advanced operations (mod, x^y, √)
9. ✓ Utility functions (AC, +/-, %)
10. ✓ History panel (collapsible)
11. ✓ Clear history functionality

**Backend Integration:**
- ✓ Connected to backend API at https://calculator-backend-morphvm-upq2ibiu.http.cloud.morph.so
- ✓ POST /api/calculate for calculations
- ✓ GET /api/history for history retrieval
- ✓ DELETE /api/history for clearing history
- ✓ Error handling for API failures
- ✓ Loading states managed
- ✓ Auto-refresh history after calculations

**External Exposure:**
- ✓ Frontend exposed at: https://frontend-morphvm-upq2ibiu.http.cloud.morph.so
- ✓ Port 3000 configured in Vite
- ✓ Allowed hosts configured for external access
- ✓ CORS working between frontend and backend

**Features Implemented:**
- ✓ Floating-point precision fix (10 decimal places rounding)
- ✓ Error messages with shake animation
- ✓ Smooth button hover effects
- ✓ Operation indicator showing current calculation
- ✓ History with timestamps
- ✓ Reverse chronological order in history
- ✓ Clear all functionality
- ✓ Responsive breakpoints for all device sizes

### Issues Found During Step 2:

#### ISSUE #4: Backend Process Stopped
- **Severity**: Critical (Resolved)
- **Description**: Backend server (Node.js) was not running when testing frontend
- **Impact**: Frontend couldn't connect to API
- **Status**: RESOLVED
- **Solution**: Restarted backend with `nohup node index.js > backend.log 2>&1 &`
- **Prevention**: Should implement process manager (PM2) for auto-restart

#### ISSUE #5: Port Conflicts
- **Severity**: Minor (Resolved)
- **Description**: Multiple Vite processes running caused port 3000 conflicts
- **Impact**: Frontend switching to port 3001 (which backend uses)
- **Status**: RESOLVED
- **Solution**: Killed all vite processes, restarted clean on port 3000
- **Prevention**: Better process cleanup procedures

#### ISSUE #6: Vite Allowed Hosts
- **Severity**: Minor (Resolved)
- **Description**: Vite blocked external host access initially
- **Impact**: External URL returning "Blocked request" error
- **Status**: RESOLVED
- **Solution**: Added external domain to `server.allowedHosts` in vite.config.js
- **Configuration Added**:
  ```javascript
  allowedHosts: [
    'frontend-morphvm-upq2ibiu.http.cloud.morph.so',
    'localhost',
    '172.16.0.2'
  ]
  ```

#### ISSUE #7: Frontend-Backend API Response Format Mismatch
- **Severity**: Medium (Resolved)
- **Description**: Frontend expected wrapped responses with `success` field, but backend returns direct data
- **Impact**: History not loading, clear history not working
- **Status**: RESOLVED
- **Details**:
  - History endpoint: Backend returns array directly, frontend expected `{success: true, history: []}`
  - Calculate endpoint: Backend returns `{operation, operand1, operand2, result}`, frontend expected `{success: true, result: ...}`
  - Clear history: Backend returns `{message: ...}`, frontend expected `{success: true}`
  - Timestamp field: Backend returns `created_at`, frontend was looking for `timestamp`
- **Solution**: Updated frontend to handle backend's actual response format
  - Check for `data.result !== undefined` instead of `data.success`
  - Check for `Array.isArray(data)` for history
  - Check for `data.message || response.ok` for clear history
  - Use `item.created_at` instead of `item.timestamp`
- **Files Changed**: `/root/calculator-app/frontend/src/App.jsx`

### Comprehensive Testing Completed ✓
