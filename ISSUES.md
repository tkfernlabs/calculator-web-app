## Step 2 - Frontend Development & Integration

### Frontend Implementation Completed ✓

**Created Components:**
1. ✓ React App with Vite build tool
2. ✓ Calculator UI component (App.jsx)
3. ✓ Modern dark theme CSS (App.css)
4. ✓ Responsive design (mobile, tablet, desktop)
5. ✓ Calculator display with operation indicator
6. ✓ Number pad (0-9, decimal point)
7. ✓ Basic operations (+, −, ×, ÷)
8. ✓ Advanced operations (mod, x^y, √)
9. ✓ Utility functions (AC, +/-, %)
10. ✓ History panel (collapsible)
11. ✓ Clear history functionality

**Backend Integration:**
- ✓ Connected to backend API at https://calculator-backend-morphvm-upq2ibiu.http.cloud.morph.so
- ✓ POST /api/calculate for calculations
- ✓ GET /api/history for history retrieval
- ✓ DELETE /api/history for clearing history
- ✓ Error handling for API failures
- ✓ Loading states managed
- ✓ Auto-refresh history after calculations

**External Exposure:**
- ✓ Frontend exposed at: https://frontend-morphvm-upq2ibiu.http.cloud.morph.so
- ✓ Port 3000 configured in Vite
- ✓ Allowed hosts configured for external access
- ✓ CORS working between frontend and backend

**Features Implemented:**
- ✓ Floating-point precision fix (10 decimal places rounding)
- ✓ Error messages with shake animation
- ✓ Smooth button hover effects
- ✓ Operation indicator showing current calculation
- ✓ History with timestamps
- ✓ Reverse chronological order in history
- ✓ Clear all functionality
- ✓ Responsive breakpoints for all device sizes

### Issues Found During Step 2:

#### ISSUE #4: Backend Process Stopped
- **Severity**: Critical (Resolved)
- **Description**: Backend server (Node.js) was not running when testing frontend
- **Impact**: Frontend couldn't connect to API
- **Status**: RESOLVED
- **Solution**: Restarted backend with `nohup node index.js > backend.log 2>&1 &`
- **Prevention**: Should implement process manager (PM2) for auto-restart

#### ISSUE #5: Port Conflicts
- **Severity**: Minor (Resolved)
- **Description**: Multiple Vite processes running caused port 3000 conflicts
- **Impact**: Frontend switching to port 3001 (which backend uses)
- **Status**: RESOLVED
- **Solution**: Killed all vite processes, restarted clean on port 3000
- **Prevention**: Better process cleanup procedures

#### ISSUE #6: Vite Allowed Hosts
- **Severity**: Minor (Resolved)
- **Description**: Vite blocked external host access initially
- **Impact**: External URL returning "Blocked request" error
- **Status**: RESOLVED
- **Solution**: Added external domain to `server.allowedHosts` in vite.config.js
- **Configuration Added**:
  ```javascript
  allowedHosts: [
    'frontend-morphvm-upq2ibiu.http.cloud.morph.so',
    'localhost',
    '172.16.0.2'
  ]
  ```

#### ISSUE #7: Frontend-Backend API Response Format Mismatch
- **Severity**: Medium (Resolved)
- **Description**: Frontend expected wrapped responses with `success` field, but backend returns direct data
- **Impact**: History not loading, clear history not working
- **Status**: RESOLVED
- **Details**:
  - History endpoint: Backend returns array directly, frontend expected `{success: true, history: []}`
  - Calculate endpoint: Backend returns `{operation, operand1, operand2, result}`, frontend expected `{success: true, result: ...}`
  - Clear history: Backend returns `{message: ...}`, frontend expected `{success: true}`
  - Timestamp field: Backend returns `created_at`, frontend was looking for `timestamp`
- **Solution**: Updated frontend to handle backend's actual response format
  - Check for `data.result !== undefined` instead of `data.success`
  - Check for `Array.isArray(data)` for history
  - Check for `data.message || response.ok` for clear history
  - Use `item.created_at` instead of `item.timestamp`
- **Files Changed**: `/root/calculator-app/frontend/src/App.jsx`

### Issues Found During Visual Testing:

#### ISSUE #8: Error Message Not Visible for Division by Zero
- **Severity**: Minor (Cosmetic)
- **Description**: When testing 5 ÷ 0, expected to see error message banner with shake animation, but no error was visible during visual testing
- **Impact**: User may not get immediate visual feedback for error conditions
- **Possible Causes**:
  1. Error message might have appeared and disappeared within 3-second timeout
  2. Error message might be hidden due to scroll position
  3. Error handling might need review
- **Status**: NEEDS INVESTIGATION
- **Note**: Backend correctly returns error (confirmed in earlier API tests), so this is a frontend display issue
- **Recommendation**: Extend error display duration from 3s to 5s, or add error styling to display area

#### ISSUE #9: Operation Indicator Text
- **Severity**: Very Minor (Cosmetic/Terminology)
- **Description**: Operation indicator shows "5 divide" instead of "5 ÷" or other mathematical symbols
- **Impact**: Slightly less polished UX - uses words instead of symbols
- **Status**: COSMETIC - Works perfectly, just uses text
- **Recommendation**: Could enhance by using operation symbols (÷, ×, −, +, ^, √, mod) instead of words, but current implementation is clear and functional

### Not Issues (Working as Expected):

✓ AC (All Clear) button clears calculator completely
✓ Number buttons responsive and accurate
✓ Decimal point allows only one decimal
